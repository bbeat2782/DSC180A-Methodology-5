**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic was the application of transformers in graph data even though there isn't a natural order in graph data.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For the Quarter 2 Project, I would like to look into how transformer based graph neural network can be used in a recommendation task. I think this can be an interesting topic since user preference does not always depend on the most recent interaction.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Currently, the code isn't organized so that the other people can easily run on their local environment. So perhaps, using .yaml file to run the main function might be helpful.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
We haven't covered it yet, but considering user preference changes over time, I would like to consider a temporal graph in my project if possible.
